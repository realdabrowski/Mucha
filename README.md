This simple webpage displays on-chain and IPFS data for a tokenized real estate
asset. To organize multiple assets, the page now uses
[List.js](https://listjs.com/) to provide search and filtering capabilities.

### Adding Assets

1. Edit `assets.json` and append new objects describing each asset.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser. The assets will be loaded and listed
   automatically.
